    "## Geographic Indexing of Grocery Prices & Socioeconomic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "This project aims to acquire, integrate, and preprocess datasets that enable an analysis of grocery product pricing, product availability, and socioeconomic conditions. The goal is to construct a clean, structured dataset that facilitates future analyses of pricing disparities and access to affordable groceries across different communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Acquisition & Integration\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ Grocery Product Pricing & Availability (Kroger)\n",
    "##### **Data Needed:**\n",
    "- Product prices at various Kroger store locations.\n",
    "- Availability of different product categories (e.g., fresh produce, dairy, packaged goods).\n",
    "- Store locations (latitude/longitude or ZIP code).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Acquisition Methods:**\n",
    "- **Kroger Public APIs**\n",
    "  - **Location API**: Provides comprehensive data on the network of Kroger stores\n",
    "  - **Product API**: Supplies location-specific product information\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### **Preprocessing Tasks:**\n",
    "- Standardizing price data (unit price normalization).\n",
    "- Handling missing or inconsistent pricing values.\n",
    "- Assigning geographic identifiers (geocoding store locations to ZIP codes/census tracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2️⃣ Demographic & Economic Data (U.S. Census 2023)\n",
    "##### **Data Needed:**\n",
    "- **Income Levels**: Median household income, poverty rate.\n",
    "- **Population Density**: Urban vs. rural classification.\n",
    "- **Ethnic Composition**: Racial and ethnic demographics.\n",
    "- **Education Levels**: Percentage of the population with a college degree.\n",
    "- **Employment Statistics**: Unemployment rate, occupation distribution.\n",
    "- **Housing & Cost of Living**: Median home value, rent prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Acquisition Methods:**\n",
    "- **U.S. Census Bureau API** ([data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov))\n",
    "  - American Community Survey (ACS) 1-Year Estimates\n",
    "    - Demographic and economic data summarizing individual American metropolitan and micropolitan areas\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Preprocessing Tasks:**\n",
    "- Mapping census data to store locations.\n",
    "- Handling missing or aggregated demographic values.\n",
    "- Normalizing data across different geographic resolutions (ZIP code vs. county level).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3️⃣ Additional Socioeconomic Factors: SNAP Participation & Food Assistance\n",
    "While not a requirement for this exercise, incorporating SNAP participation data per store and the rate of SNAP participation per household in each geographic area could enhance the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since household income data is available via census sources, SNAP participation rates could serve as a complementary indicator of a community’s relative wealth. Analyzing food pricing in these communities could help determine whether grocery chains adjust prices based on local economic conditions or maintain a uniform pricing model across different income brackets.\n"

    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose of This Data**\n",
    " \n",
    "The goal of assembling this dataset is to analyze how a national retailer like Kroger adjusts product pricing across diverse markets, considering their unique demographic and economic characteristics. Specifically, this project seeks to identify whether there is a correlation between regional market profiles and pricing strategies, including variations in product category diversity and affordability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging data from Kroger’s extensive store network, which spans a wide range of metropolitan and suburban areas, this analysis aims to provide insights into potential pricing disparities. Understanding these patterns could help answer key questions, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do lower-income areas experience proportionally lower grocery prices relative to wealthier neighborhoods?\n",
    "- Is product availability and category diversity consistent across different economic regions, or does it vary based on market demand and demographic features?\n",
    "- Does Kroger employ a dynamic pricing strategy, adjusting for local economic conditions, or is pricing relatively uniform nationwide?\n",
    "- Does Kroger employ different pricing strategies  for each chain and/or division or is it consistent across all stores? \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the heightened public attention on grocery pricing and affordability, this study seeks to contribute a data-driven perspective to a discussion often dominated by subjective viewpoints. By structuring and analyzing this dataset, we aim to provide a clearer, evidence-based understanding of pricing trends and their potential implications for consumers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intended Audience**  \n",
    "This dataset is relevant to a broad audience, as grocery pricing directly affects nearly every American household. In recent years, price volatility has increased due to a range of factors, including large-scale weather events intensified by climate change, mass food recalls, and livestock disease outbreaks. These disruptions have led to fluctuating prices and inconsistent availability of staple commodities, challenging consumer expectations of affordability and accessibility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these trends is essential for multiple stakeholders:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consumers & Advocacy Groups:** Many households are struggling with the rising cost of food, and consumers are becoming more conscious of regional disparities in pricing and product availability. This analysis could provide transparency into how pricing strategies vary across different economic and demographic landscapes, helping consumers make more informed decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Policy Makers & Economists:** With food insecurity and affordability becoming critical policy issues, government agencies and economists can use this data to better understand pricing structures in different communities. Insights from this study could inform policies aimed at promoting fair access to groceries and reducing price disparities between high- and low-income areas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retail & Supply Chain Analysts:** Industry professionals in grocery retail, supply chain management, and food distribution can leverage this data to assess how pricing strategies respond to regional demand, supply disruptions, and economic conditions. This could help inform business decisions regarding localized pricing, inventory management, and product assortment strategies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Climate & Agricultural Researchers:** Given that climate change is increasingly affecting agricultural output and food supply chains, researchers studying the intersection of environmental factors and food pricing could use this dataset to analyze how extreme weather events correlate with price fluctuations at a granular level.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the pricing strategies of one of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., this study seeks to provide actionable insights that go beyond anecdotal evidence. Whether for individual consumers, policymakers, businesses, or researchers, this data has the potential to contribute to a clearer, more evidence-based understanding of the economic and social factors shaping the cost of food.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Study Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "This study focuses exclusively on pricing dynamics within Kroger’s network of stores due to data availability. While Kroger holds a significant market presence as the second-largest grocery retailer in the United States, its roughly 10% market share means it is far from representative of the entire national grocery landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this study does not account for alternative grocery retailers that cater to different consumer segments, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Budget-focused retailers** (e.g., Dollar General, Aldi) that often offer lower-cost alternatives.\n",
    "- **Membership-based wholesale clubs** (e.g., Costco, Sam’s Club) where pricing structures differ due to bulk purchasing models.\n",
    "- **Regional grocery chains** that may follow distinct pricing strategies influenced by local market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, this analysis remains valuable in contributing to a broader discussion on grocery pricing, cost of living, and affordability. However, it is essential to recognize that Kroger's pricing strategies may not reflect the experience of all consumers nationwide. Future studies incorporating data from multiple retailers could provide a more comprehensive view of pricing dynamics across the grocery industry.\n"

    "- `items.inventory.stockLevel`: Stock status per store.\n",
    "\n",
    "### U.S. Census Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the unpredictability of API access for Census data and all government data currently, I will fetch raw census data manually and store in csv files locally. This data will need to be cleaned, but it will ensure stable availability of Census data. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Progress\n",
    "### **Authentication & Request Workflow**\n",
    "1. **Obtain API Credentials**\n",
    "   - Register for a Kroger Developer Account to obtain API keys.\n",
